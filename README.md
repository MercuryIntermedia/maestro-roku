## Why maestro?

### Maestro Makes roku development easier, especially for experienced software engineers from other platforms:

I believe that experienced developers from android, ios, c#, web, node, etc, should be able to be productive on a roku app in no more than a week, just as they would on any other platform. So I wrote maestro to make that possible.

Maestro is built to:

 - Raise velocity
 - Increase productivity
 - Reduce learning
 - Simply cross-skilling
 - Make roku development more fun
 - Produce roku apps that can be maintained by non roku developer
 - Produce roku apps that can be unit tested easily
 - Write code that can be tested and breakpoint debugged, outside of SG views (which are slow as hell, and prone to crashing when breakpoint debugging)

## Quick start

COMING SOON: Separate sample project.

  - Clone this repo
  - `npm install`

NOTE: To debug with RALE, you need to use a specific version, as the RALETracker task in my project is locked at 2.1.7 - I have downloads of those versions [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gZZcndEpSO6zDVkx09UpYJtPb7OTf6Nq?usp=sharing).
