# Overview

Lists on roku, without the headache and heartbreak

## About

The maestro list component allows us to make screens, that are much like NetFlix (cerca 2022), with a much simpler programming model than the standard roku framework lists and grids


## Status: Approaching completion

Maestro list is approaching completion. It's currently being rolled out on some forward thinking clients, who I thank most graciously for understanding the reasons for this project and supporting it's development.

The main use cases are covered and robust; there are a few bugs here and there, which are being hammered out.

### Known bugs

 - Focus revoervery is unreliable when changing contents of the list
 - OnFocus updates can get confused between grid sub-rows
 - Some race conditions still exist, when updating lists


### TODO

 - floating focus in horizontal rows
 - Optimizing: It performs great; but is still not optimized
